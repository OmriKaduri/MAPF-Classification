             Calculates the minimum number of replans to solve, and from it the minimum number of replans or merges to solve.
             
             A replan can resolve all of the agent's conflicts by luck, even if it was only targeting a single conflict.
            
             To calculate the minimum number of replans to solve, 
             what we want is the size of the minimum vertex cover of the conflict graph.
             Sadly, it's an NP-hard problem. Its decision variant is NP-complete.
             Happily, it has a 2-approximation: Just choose both endpoints of each uncovered edge repeatedly until no uncovered edges are lef.
             
             So we can just take half the count from that approximation.
             
             Notice a merge is like two replans in one, so we might need to take ceil(num_replans/2).
             Luckily, in Cbs_LocalConflicts, a merge is only possible once every B+1 depth steps,
             because we only count selected conflicts (they're guaranteed to be unequal),
             so we can cap the number of possible merges and substract less.
             
             In Cbs_GlobalConflicts, we could use the global table to discount some merges.

            Represents a pattern database that enumerates all possible

            32-bit integer. A lookup table in memory maps each 32-bit integer
            representation of the state to a heuristic estimate. In order to reduce

            stored as the difference on top of the single shortest path heuristic.
            The hope is that the reduced magnitude of heuristic values will now
            always fit within the range of a single unsigned byte. This assumption,
            of course, will break on instances that are large enough to cause an

            This class represents a state in the A* search with operator decomposition, as proposed by IndependenceDetection Scott Standley's AAAI paper in 2010.
            More specifically, states can represent a partial move, in which only some of the agents have moved
            and the other have not yet moved in this turn.
